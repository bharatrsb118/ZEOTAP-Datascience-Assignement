# ZEOTAP-Datascience-Assignement
taks1:
This notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on transactions, products, and customers datasets. It includes the following steps:

Import necessary libraries.
Load datasets into pandas DataFrames.
Clean the data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
Generate summary statistics for the datasets.
Analyze the distribution of transactions over time.
Identify top-selling products based on total sales value and quantity sold.
Analyze customer demographics such as region and signup date.
Analyze sales distribution across different regions.
Derive business insights from the EDA.

task2:
This notebook explains the development of a lookalike model that recommends similar customers based on their profile and transaction history. It includes the following steps:

Import necessary libraries.
Load and preprocess datasets.

Calculate similarity scores for target customers.
Save the recommendations to a CSV file.

task3:
This notebook performs customer segmentation using clustering techniques. It includes the following steps:

Import necessary libraries.
